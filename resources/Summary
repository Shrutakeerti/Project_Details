Problem Statement:
The problem addressed in the documents is the challenge of learning from ambiguously labeled data, 
which is a common issue in fields such as computer vision, bioinformatics, and text processing. 
Traditional supervised learning requires precisely labeled data, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in many real-world scenarios. 
The problem is framed within the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm,
where labels are assigned to groups of instances (bags) rather than individual instances, 
and the goal is to predict whether a bag contains at least one positive instance, without knowing the individual instance labels.

Dataset:
The documents mention the use of several datasets, 
including the MUSK dataset introduced by Dietterich et al. in 1997,
which is commonly used to evaluate MIL algorithms.
This dataset consists of molecule shape statistics and is used to predict whether a molecule has a "musky" smell.
Additionally, the VFHQ and HDTF datasets are used in the context of head avatar reconstruction, containing video clips and frames for training and evaluating models.

Methodology:
The documents review various MIL algorithms, which are categorized based on cost functions and optimization methods.
These include naive MIL, PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) algorithms, and maximum likelihood and maximum margin methods such as MIL-SVM. 
The documents also discuss the application of MIL in different domains, such as image classification (part/whole ambiguity) and bioinformatics (classifying biological sequences).
For head avatar reconstruction, the GPAvatar method is introduced, which uses a dynamic point-based expression field and a Multi Tri-planes Attention (MTA) fusion module for precise expression control
and multi-view consistency.

Conclusion:
The documents conclude by emphasizing the need for further research to develop MIL algorithms that are tailored to specific application domains,
particularly those involving part/whole ambiguity. 
They also highlight the importance of considering the theoretical properties of MIL datasets and making appropriate assumptions.
Additionally, the GPAvatar paper concludes with acknowledgments for the support received and provides a link to the code for reproducibility. 
The paper on MIL ends with a discussion on the performance of different MIL algorithms and the observation that no single algorithm is universally best, as performance varies depending on the dataset.
